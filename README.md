# Stress_Test_For_CP
wrote a batch script for window cmd which generates different input and run my two codes on the same input file till I find different output. if found it'll open the inp.txt file.


instructions - 

1. Make changes in the gen.cpp according to the inputs you want to generate.
2. run both A.cpp and B.cpp and save their exe file with a.exe and b.exe respectively.
3. now make changes in the path of inp1.txt and inp2.txt. So basically you've to make these input files before running the script.
4. after done with the follow thing. just run the script.bat file adjusting the number of times you want to check.
5. Bingo! you'll see the verdict of each case on the cmd. if different output is found. it'll break the loop and open the input file.

Happy Coding !!
